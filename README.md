### C++ AVL Tree

While studying computer science at Dakota State University in 2021, I created this AVL Tree as part
of an assignment for Advanced Data Structures.

Original code was written during that class. After graduating in 2022, I refactored the project and
updated the git structure. Feel free to use any of this code in learning AVL Trees in C++.
